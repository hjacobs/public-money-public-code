Public Money - Public Code!
===========================

Why is software created using taxpayersâ€™ money not released as Free Software? 

We want legislation requiring that publicly financed software developed for the public sector be made publicly available under a Free and Open Source Software licence. If it is public money, it should be public code as well. 

Code paid by the people should be available to the people!
