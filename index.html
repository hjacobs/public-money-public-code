		<h1>Public Money &mdash; Public Code!</h1>
            <p class="lead">We think that publicly funded software should be available to the
            public.
            Procurement by publicly funded institutions should favor <a href="https://fsfe.org/about/basics/freesoftware.en.html">Free
                Software</a> and software developed in house should be released to the
             public. This increases tax efficiency and simplifies cooperation
             between public administrations. </p>

          <h4>Waste of Taxpayers' Money</h4>
          <p>Public institutions spend <strong>millions of Euros every year for licenses of proprietary software</strong>.
          Even more is spend for the development of new software that is specifically tailored for the needs of public institutions
          – but cannot be used freely because of proprietary licenses.
          This creates absurd situations, when the same project idea such as a tool for reporting broken public infrastructure in a community is realized with a variety of different proprietary software solutions which are developed and paid for multiple times with public money from various public administrations.</p>

		  <h4>Security Issues</h4>
		  <p>The wide use of proprietary software licenses has severe consequences for security issues since the possibilities to detect and fix security loopholes as well as exclude the possibility for unwanted backdoors are limited.</p>

		  <h4>Free Software</h4>
          <p>There is still little awareness for the <strong>benefits of implementing mandatory open licensing models in public procurement</strong> projects. The campaign “public money public code” by the FSFE has the goal to improve the awareness of policy makers and the general public on the issue of free software and public procurement processes. It shall encourage a policy change to implement open licensing as a default setting in public procurement.</p>
